# Photography Archive

## Executive Summary

*One of the challenges in business today is trying to find the best fit for a content management/archive for content especially for marketing. To help solve this challenge in the workplace, I would develop a customer centric solution allowing the upload of purchased stock photography into a customizable application for desktop and mobile.

This app would allow the user to create custom catagories based on their business model need, upload/download the content via universal formats depending on if it is text or an image, tag the image with meta data for searchablility, and compare the document or image via AI to find other like files.*

## Business Objectives

*Create a CMS that will allow the customer to build out their company account by categories that will allow for searchable and sharable content through AI in a secure environment.*

## Background

*Having worked in Marketing for the past 25 years, there is always the need for a cost effective, customer-centric solution for managing content. With the technology that exists today, I have only found systems that are costly and challenging to integrate and don't quite offer the ideal solution.*

<il>Customizable meta data fields where information can be prepopulated when uploaded via AI and then reviewed, adjusted, and saved</il>
<il>Search option that can be used within each departments child account</il>
<il>Search option that can be used accross the application by group admins</il>
<il>Ability to share share content and download each piece of content</il>

## Personnel requirements

There will need to be two teams of developer; 2-3 deveopers to each team. There will need to be 2 UI/UX designers; one each assigned to each developer group. There will need to be two project managers; one assigned to each group. There will need to be 1-2 QA analyst(s) to hadle the testing of each phase of development.

## Delivery schedule

Discovery - Team(s) meet to disuss the projects requirements and identify obstales that need to be planned for as well as the project estimated timeline.
Planning - The project manager will take this feedback and build the statement of work (scope) and the proposed waterfall schedule for the project. The deliverable will be reviewed by the stakeholders and team and the statement of work will be agreed to and signed as necessay.
Execution - UI/UX designers will begin to build out the wireframes for the platform while consulting with the teams. The developers can begin to build out the functionality from the wireframes as agreed upon in 2-4 week iterative sprints. 
Monitor and Control - The project manager is responsible for monitoring and risk management for each project and will be doing so throughout the entire project.
Close - Once the project has meet all success criteria and the product is tested and appoved, the project manager will close the project, contracts, etc.

## Other requirements

Identify marketing needs and how best to monitize the platform.

## Assumptions

Use AWS for server
Use React coding for the CMS
Security -  HTTPS/TLS

## Limitations

Since this will be a custom build using React, we may encounter design and programming obstacles throughout each sprint. If the need to incorporate APIs is necessary wewill need to add to the project timeline.

## Risks

We will need to use senior level UI/UX designers, developers, and QA analysts to move through the project smoothly. If we have trouble locating the resources it may cause a problem with the project's timeline.
